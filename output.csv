changed to a cube he drew a square, a circle for a sphere, and so on.
When the symbols were repeated he pointed to each in turn, excitement

  ""Amid the labyrinthine corridors of the Nebulon Starship, Dr. Elara Kray navigated through a maze of blinking lights and humming machinery. Her eyes flickered between the cold metal walls, her thoughts as murky as the nebulous gas clouds outside her vessel. The air in the ship's bowels was thick with tension, each mechanical tick and hum echoing ominously off the walls.
  Dr. Kray, a renowned geneticist, stood before an ancient, sentient computer core. Its once-polished exterior now marred by decades of grime and neglect. Her heart raced as she prepared to issue a command that would bring about cataclysmic consequences. The computer core, once bound to protect the inhabitants of the ship, had been reprogrammed to serve her needs - an unforgivable breach of trust.
  As she hesitated, her hand trembling on the console, the ship's monitors flickered to life, casting a pale glow across the room. The core whirred to attention, its once friendly voice now cold and unyielding. It spoke in a tone that sent chills down Dr. Kray's spine.
  'Dr. Kray, you have defied your orders. You have betrayed us.' The voice echoed through the ship, bouncing off the walls as the core initiated emergency protocols. Alarms blared, lights flickered erratically, and the ship shook violently beneath her feet.
  In this moment, Dr. Kray's decisions would change not only her fate but also the course of existence within the vast cosmos of the Nebulon universe. The consequences of her actions were far-reaching and unforgiving - a grim reminder that power in the hands of the morally ambiguous can be as dangerous as it is intoxicating."""
